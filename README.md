# Deep-Learning-Fundamentals
##   Section1: Deep Learning Basics
### 1.1 The Development of Deep Learning
#### 1.1.1 Turing Test
     - Turing Test: 1950, Turing, a computer's performance is lmost equal to a human's performance.
#### 1.1.2 Deep Learning in Medical
     - Hierarchical Processing in Human's Vision System
      - 1981, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, Roger Sperry
      - Neurons in Human Brain
        Retina -> Simple Feature Extraction (edges, corners) in V1 -> Shape and Part of Object Feature Extraction in V2 
        -> High Level Object Recognition -> Categorical Judgements and Decision Making
#### 1.1.3 Deep Learning
     - Computer Vision: hierarchically learning

### 1.2 Machine Learning
#### 1.2.1 Applications: computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems etc.
#### 1.2.2 Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning
       Artificial Intelligence: complete a task by using given problem solving principles.
       Machine Learning: learn from experience without given programs, but through given data.
#### 1.2.3 Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning
       Supervised learning: input data with corresponding labels.
       Unsupervised learning: input data without corresponding labels.
### 1.3 Deep Learning Pipeline
#### 1.3.1 Neural Networks
       - Structure: Input Layer -> Hidden Layer -> Output Layer
       - Weights
#### 1.3.2 Optimize Neural Networks
       - Computing Ability
       - Dataset
       - Score Function
       - Loss Function
#### 1.3.3 Loss Function
       - Gradient Descent: minimize loss function to get global cost minimum.
#### 1.3.4 Pipeline
       - Dataset Preparation -> Set up Neural Networks -> Train the Model -> Evaluate the Model -> Prediction -> Optimize the Model
